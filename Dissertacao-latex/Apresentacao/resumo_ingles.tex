\begin{resumo}[ABSTRACT]	
Prediction in the e-marketplace is a considerable resource for stock research. In view of, computational techniques have been applied to carry out analyzes within the update scenario. Among the techniques, such as Artificial Neural Networks, a subarea of Artificial Intelligence that seeks to simulate computationally a form of human brain processing, have been gaining prominence for this purpose. Thus, this work presents a specification and applicability of an RNA model to make predictions on the value of stock openings on the NASDAQ stock exchange. In addition, there are evidenced and detailed tools that help to develop this technique efficiently, we use a Python programming language and its libraries for data analysis.
